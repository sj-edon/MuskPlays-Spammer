# 🐘 MuskPlays Spammer / Mammoth Extinction 
### Because scammers shouldn’t get to have nice things

We live in an era where some folks genuinely believe billionaires teamed up to create an online casino, and then act surprised when their life savings mysteriously evaporate into a crypto wallet registered in a country no one can point to on a map.  

Meanwhile, the phishing crews that operate these webites sit behind their dollar-store dashboards pretending to run a “customer support center,” sipping instant coffee and waiting for the next victim to stumble in.  

This little script exists as a reminder that the internet is still a battlefield — and the scammers aren’t the only ones with scripts.

## 🚀 What This Thing Does
This project is a fully asynchronous load-testing tool designed to stress test an HTTP endpoint with dynamic concurrency, adaptive throttling, and enough meme energy to break down poorly built scam panels.

It sends repeated POST requests with configurable payloads, adjusts concurrency based on latency, tracks status codes, and generally behaves like a caffeinated raccoon hammering on a keyboard.

Use it responsibly:  
**Run it against your own systems, your own test environments, your own stink-bait honeypots.**  
Don't point it at anything you don’t have permission to test unless you enjoy government-issued fashion.

## 🧠 Why It Exists
Phishing campaigns rely on volume, confusion, and desperation.  
Victims often feel powerless — like their only defense is unplugging the router and hoping the universe stops targeting them.

This project stands as a middle finger raised in the general direction of scammers everywhere.  
A reminder that people aren’t helpless.  
A reminder that scam victims aren’t stupid — they’re attacked, targeted, and manipulated.  
And a reminder to every criminal crew running a “support ticket” panel on a $2 VPS that the internet community is tired of their nonsense.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Async requests via `aiohttp`
- Dynamic concurrency scaling  
- Token bucket for rate limiting  
- Latency-based adaptation  
- Status tracking, pretty printing, and a final summary  
- Payload templating using `{i}` to make every request unique  

Run it with:

`python3 test_post_dynamic_full.py`

If you are getting a lot of errors, cookie is likely dead. Simply create a new account on trumpsino/muskplays and replace it with the default token (the same cookie works on both sites due to their endpoints being hosted on the same servers)

You can find the cookie extremely easily by opening the network tab at any given time.

## 🦾 Rise Up, Stay Smart

Scam victims aren’t the problem.
Scammers are.
Educate people around you.
Warn your friends.
And keep the internet just a little bit better than it was yesterday.
